## **Improvments / Discussions**

- Frontend tests

I wanted to add them but I run out of time and as I mentioned it, I'm only starting now to implement tests and this is the part when I need to improve.

- Using Redux!

I wanted to avoid using Redux as the app is small. However, I realised I'm more used to Redux that I thought, and using it would have been easier to handle states, and avoid a memory leak ðŸ™ˆ
